# Configuration
By default the command line library is disabled for your site, to enable it you need to add values to the appsettings.json file for your site.

```json
 "uSync": {
    "Commands": {
      "Enabled": "hmac,basic",
      "key": "HMAC-KEY-VALUE",
      "UserId" : -1
    }
  }
```

## Options
 
### Enabled
Turns on the Authentication methods for the command line - acceptible values are hmac (key based) and basic (username and password based)

### Key 
The security key to use when using hmac (key based) authentication, this is the key that you would then need to use on the command line when running remote commands against your site. 

```
usync run [command] https://you-site.com/umbraco -k <KEY-VALUE-HERE>
```

## UserId
When using Key based authentication Umbraco will authenticate the commands against the default user (-1) unless you set the UserId value - this will then set the permissions for the user to be the same as for the user id you set.
